# Credit-Card-Validator

Here, Luhn’s algorithm is used to validate a user's credit card. 
The program works for all popular cards like Visa, Amex, MasterCard, etc. Luhn’s algorithm checks for basic validations; for example, a Visa card should start with 4 and then moves on to complex digit-wise calculations. 
Since most e-commerce transactions require credit card validation, the program has vast real world applications.
